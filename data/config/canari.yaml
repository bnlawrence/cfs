# Facets are the keys which are parsed out of files into the database 
#    Each facet can be optionally associated with a URL to a controlled vocabulary json 
#    file. If the url is present, ingestion will validate against the CV (one day)
# For CANARI, some of these facets have been rewritten, we use the rewritten facet_names
atomic_facets: 'experiment,source_id,variant_label,realm'
# default facets will always include standard_name, long_name, realm, and frequency. and realm.
# these are corrected facets, not necessarily those in the original file, depending
