This python package provides the CFS store command line tools and django gui.

It is a complete refactor of an earlier code, but this version has not yet reached the functionality of the previous code. All we can do here is run the unit tests, and run a simple hello world django.

There is one mini-real world tests which is in the data directory, canari.py. You will need a dataset to run that (but it doesn't get to the point of needing data right now).

Meanwhile, you can get the dynamic documentation by running mkdocs serve in the root directory (next to the mkdocs.yml file).

pytest should run the tests, and currently all are passing.
